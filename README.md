## INTRODUTION

- This Project contains a python file to detect hands and count number of fingers open (zero if non is open)
- Who wants to use it in his/her project for detection hands and count fingers.

Once it is installed you are good to run the Script or can call it in your own project
:thumbsup:

**This Project needs a Hand Detection File which is porvided in the project or you can download from**
```bash
https://github.com/VedantRaj3907/Hand-Detection-And-Tracking-Module-Python-OpenCV
```

- Or You can just write this line of code to import in your Counting_Fingers.py file (if not presented)
```bash
 import HandDetectionModule as htm
```

- If you want to import the Counting_Fingers.py file in your own porject make sure you got both **Counting_Fingers.py** file and **HandDetectionModule.py** file and just write this code in your project Script<br><br>
